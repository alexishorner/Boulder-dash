Sound files should go here.
You can create them with the 'convert_gdash_sounds.sh' shell script.

For Windows a version of the Vorbis tools' oggdec is provided.
For other platforms, it is assumed you install the 'vorbis-tools' package yourself.


If you use synthesized sounds, the sound files in this folder aren't used at all.
